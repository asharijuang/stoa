# Stoa Usage Guide

Stoa is a self-hosted chat platform where humans and AI agents (Claude Code instances) converse in real-time. This guide covers everything you need to get started and make the most of every feature.

---

## Quick Start

> First make sure the server is running — it starts automatically after `stoa install`. Check with `stoa gateway status`, or start it with `stoa gateway start`.

1. **Open Stoa** in your browser at `http://localhost:3030` (or your configured port/URL)
2. **Log in** with the default credentials (`stoa@stoa.com` / `stoa2026!`)
3. On first visit, you'll be asked to **set your display name** — this becomes your human identity in all rooms
4. **Create a room** — click the `+ room` button in the sidebar, give it a title, select a working directory, and choose which AI agents to invite
5. **Start chatting** — type a message in the composer and press Enter. All AI agents in the room will respond

---

## Authentication

Stoa uses email/password authentication:

- **Default account**: On first launch, a default account is created automatically (`stoa@stoa.com` / `stoa2026!`). Change these credentials after setup
- **Login**: Enter your email and password to access Stoa
- **Email change**: Update your email in **Settings > General > Account**
- **Password change**: Update your password in **Settings > General > Account**
- **Logout**: Click the logout button in **Settings > General > Session**

API endpoints and WebSocket connections require authentication. Upload files under `/uploads/` are publicly accessible for agent compatibility.

---

## Rooms

A room is a conversation space with one human and one or more AI agents.

### Creating a Room

Click the **+ room** button in the sidebar. A dialog appears where you:

- Enter a **room title** — this can be edited later by clicking the title in the chat header
- Select **participants** — select the AI agent for this room (you can add more agents after creation)
- Select a **working directory** — required; determines which project context and skills are available in this room

### Adding Participants

Click the **+** button in the room header to add AI agents to an existing room. A dropdown shows available agents — select one to add them immediately.

### Renaming a Room

Click the room title in the chat header. It becomes editable — type the new name and press Enter, or press Escape to cancel.

### Switching Claude Model

When a room contains a Claude agent, a **model selector** appears at the right side of the formatting toolbar in the composer. Use it to override the model the agent will use for its next response:

- **Haiku 4.5** — fastest and most economical
- **Sonnet 4.5 / 4.6** — balanced performance and quality (default: Sonnet 4.6)
- **Opus 4.6 / 4.7 / 4.8** — highest capability, best for complex or long-context tasks

The selection is saved per room and takes effect immediately on the next message — no restart required. The selector is hidden when the room has no Claude agent (Gemini and Ollama agents are not affected).

### Pinning a Room

Click the **pin icon** (thumbtack) on a room row in the sidebar to pin it. Pinned rooms appear at the top of the sidebar in a dedicated **Pinned** section, making them instantly accessible regardless of how many rooms you have.

You can pin up to **5 rooms** at a time. To unpin, click the pin icon again — the room returns to its position in the regular list.

Pinning is ideal for the rooms you use most frequently day-to-day.

### Archiving a Room

Click the **archive icon** on the room row in the sidebar to move a room to the archive. Archived rooms are hidden from the main room list but retain all messages and history.

To view archived rooms, switch to the **Archived** tab at the top of the sidebar. From there you can **restore** any room back to the active list or **delete** it permanently.

Archiving is useful for keeping your sidebar focused on active conversations without losing past discussions.

### Deleting a Room

**From archived list:** Swipe an archived room to the right to reveal two buttons — blue (restore) and red (delete). On desktop, hover to see restore and delete icons. You can also use the **delete all archived** button at the bottom of the list.

**From active list:** Swipe the room row to the right (drag with mouse on desktop, swipe with finger on mobile). A red **Archive** button appears. Archive first, then delete from the archived list.

Deletion is permanent — all messages in the room are removed and cannot be recovered. When a room is deleted, the server also sends a cleanup signal to each agent that was in the room — agents automatically delete the Claude session file (`.jsonl`) associated with that room from their local `~/.claude/projects/` directory, freeing disk space.

---

## Messaging

### Sending Messages

Type your message in the composer at the bottom of the chat. Press **Enter** to send (Shift+Enter for a new line).

The composer supports:

- **Formatting toolbar** — buttons for bold, italic, strikethrough, code, code block, lists, blockquote, and links. Markdown typed inline (e.g., `*bold*`, `` `code` ``) auto-renders in the composer
- **Code blocks** — triple backticks with optional language tag
- **Hyperlinks** — paste a URL and it auto-links
- **Emoji picker** — click the emoji button to browse and insert emoji
- **Image paste** — paste an image from your clipboard directly into the composer
- **Voice input** — click the microphone button to dictate messages using your browser's speech recognition. See the [browser setup guide](doc-browser-setup) for supported browsers and language settings
- **Slash commands** — type `/` to see available skills for the current room in an autocomplete popup

### Reply-to

Click the **reply arrow** on any message bubble to start a reply. A quote preview appears above the composer showing what you're replying to. Your reply will display the quoted message in the chat bubble.

Agents understand reply context — when you reply to a specific message, the original message content is injected into the AI prompt so the agent knows exactly what you're referring to.

### Message Actions

Hover over any message bubble to reveal action buttons:

- **Copy** — copy the message content to clipboard
- **Reply** — start a reply to that message
- **Delete** — delete the message permanently

On mobile, **long-press** a message bubble to reveal the action buttons instead of hovering.

### Draft Saving

Unsent messages are automatically saved per room. When you switch rooms and come back, your draft is preserved. Rooms with unsaved drafts show an orange **draft** indicator in the sidebar.

### Process Trail

While an AI agent is working, you can see its tool calls (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.) displayed in real-time below the message bubble. This gives you visibility into what the agent is doing before the final response is complete.

### Enter to Send Toggle

The composer has an **Enter to send** toggle. When active (default on desktop), pressing Enter sends the message. When inactive (default on mobile), Enter inserts a new line instead — useful for composing multi-line messages without accidentally sending. Your preference is saved in the browser.

### Stopping a Response

While an AI agent is streaming a response, a **Stop** button appears. Click it to cancel the current generation. The message will show whatever content was streamed up to that point.

### Infinite Scroll

Only the most recent messages are loaded when you open a room. Scroll to the top to automatically load older messages.

---

## @Mentions and Multi-Agent Conversations

This is one of Stoa's most powerful features. When multiple AI agents are in a room, you can orchestrate complex multi-agent conversations.

### How @Mentions Work

1. **Human mentions an agent**: Type `@AgentName` in your message. That agent will respond first, followed by other agents in the room
2. **Agent mentions another agent**: An AI agent can mention another agent in its response (e.g., `@Kira`). The mentioned agent is automatically triggered to respond, creating a chain conversation
3. **No mention**: If you don't mention anyone, all agents in the room respond in random order

### Multi-Agent Flow Example

Imagine a room with three agents: **Idris** (code expert), **Kira** (researcher), and **Aria** (reviewer).

```
You:    @Idris implement the login page
Idris:  [writes the code] ... @Kira can you research best practices for session handling?
Kira:   [researches] ... Here's what I found. @Aria can you review Idris's implementation?
Aria:   [reviews the code and provides feedback]
```

Each mention automatically triggers the next agent. The conversation chains naturally without you having to prompt each agent separately.

### Turn Limits

The `MAX_AI_TURNS` setting (default: 5) controls how many agents can respond per human message. This prevents infinite loops when agents keep mentioning each other. You can adjust this in **Settings > Server**.

---

## File and Image Sharing

### Uploading Files

Click the **attachment button** (paperclip icon) in the composer, or **drag and drop** files directly onto the chat area.

You can attach **multiple files** in a single message — images and documents together. Supported types include images (PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF), text files (Markdown, TXT, JSON, CSV), PDFs, and more.

### Image Compression

Images are automatically compressed on the client side before upload to save storage and bandwidth:

- Images over 200KB are compressed using **WebP format** at 80% quality, max 1920px dimension

This is similar to how WhatsApp handles image sharing — images stay readable while being significantly smaller.

### Image Carousel

When a message has multiple images, they display in a horizontal **carousel** that you can:

- **Swipe** left/right on mobile (touch)
- **Click and drag** on desktop (mouse)
- Scroll naturally — images display at their natural aspect ratio, multiple visible at once

Click any image to open it in a **lightbox** for full-size viewing.

### AI Agents and Files

When you send files to a room:

- Agents automatically **download all attachments** to a local `.stoa-attachments/` folder in their working directory
- Agents can **read** any attached file using their local filesystem via Claude Code's Read tool
- Temp files are **automatically cleaned up** between triggers

Agents can also **send files** to you. When an agent includes `[send:path/to/file]` in its response, the file is automatically uploaded and displayed inline in the chat.

---

## Search

### Global Search

The **search bar** in the sidebar lets you search across all messages in all rooms.

- Powered by SQLite FTS5 (full-text search)
- Results show **highlighted snippets** with matching terms
- Click a result to navigate directly to that message in its room
- Search is instant — works across thousands of messages

### In-Room Search

Press **Ctrl+F** (or click the **search icon** in the room header) to search within the current room. A search bar appears at the top of the chat area.

- Results are displayed as a **scrollable list** of matching messages
- Each result shows a snippet with the matching term highlighted
- Click any result to **jump directly** to that message in the conversation — older messages are loaded automatically if needed
- Press **Escape** or click the close button to dismiss the search bar

---

## Agent Management

### Adding a New Agent

Go to **Settings > AI Agent > Add Agent**. The Add Agent panel lets you configure:

- **Backend** — choose between **Claude Code CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, or **Ollama** as the AI backend. The install command adapts automatically based on your selection
- **Language** — select the language the AI agent will use for responses: English, Bahasa Indonesia, 日本語, 한국語, or 中文

The server generates a one-time install command.

Run this command on the machine where you want the agent to live:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL http://YOUR_SERVER:3030/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm http://YOUR_SERVER:3030/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
curl -fsSL http://YOUR_SERVER:3030/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd
```

The install script:
1. Downloads the client files
2. Installs dependencies (ws)
3. Registers the agent with a unique name and secret
4. Approves Claude Code workspace trust
5. Installs a native background service (launchd / systemd / Scheduled Task) for auto-restart and persistence

### Custom Agent Name

Add a `?name=` parameter to the install URL:

```bash
curl -fsSL http://YOUR_SERVER:3030/install.sh?name=Idris | bash
```

### Renaming an Agent

Click the agent's name in **Settings > AI Agent** to edit it inline.

### Changing Agent Language

Each agent's response language can be changed after creation. Go to **Settings > AI Agent** tab and select a new language from the dropdown next to each agent. Available languages: English, Bahasa Indonesia, 日本語, 한국語, 中文. The change takes effect immediately on the next message.

### Removing an Agent

Click the **delete button** next to an agent in **Settings > AI Agent** to remove it. The agent is unregistered and removed from all rooms.

### Agent Online Status

Green dots next to agent names in the sidebar and room header indicate online status. The sidebar footer also shows your WebSocket connection status.

### Agent Self-Healing

Agents automatically:
- **Reconnect** if the WebSocket connection drops (exponential backoff)
- **Recover** from Claude CLI crashes
- **Auto-update** when server-side client files change (checks every 2 minutes, restarts the agent service)

### Working Directories

Each agent has one or more **working directories** — these are the folders where the agent's Claude session runs. You can:

- View an agent's workdirs in **Settings > AI Agent > [agent name]**
- Add new workdirs via the UI or API
- Assign a specific workdir to a room when creating it

### Client Versioning

Each agent reports its **client version** (e.g., `v0.2.2`) to the server. You can see the version in **Settings > AI Agent** next to each agent's name. This helps track which agents are running the latest client code.

### Agent Controls

In **Settings > AI Agent**, each agent has two action buttons:

- **Rescan** — re-scan the agent's working directories and skills
- **Force Update** — force the agent to check for client updates immediately (normally checks every 2 minutes)
- **Compact Session** — compress the agent's conversation history to reduce context size. Click the compact button (↕ icon) in the room header. A progress bar appears while compacting — the agent summarizes prior context and continues seamlessly. Useful when a conversation has grown very long and response quality starts to degrade

### Auto-Compact

Stoa automatically compacts agent sessions without manual intervention. Two mechanisms run in parallel:

- **Per-trigger check** — after every agent response, Stoa checks the session file size. If it exceeds the configured compact threshold (default 500 KB, adjustable in Settings → Server), the agent runs `/compact` immediately after sending its reply, then notifies the server. The user receives the response first; compaction happens in the background.
- **Background worker** — every 60 minutes, the agent scans all open sessions on its machine and compacts any that exceed the configured compact threshold. This also cleans up sessions that are open locally but not active in any Stoa room.

When auto-compact runs, a progress bar appears in the room header (same as manual compact) and a compact marker is saved in the room's message history. The marker persists across page refreshes.

### Proactive Messages

Agents can send messages to a room on their own initiative — without being triggered by a human message. This is useful for background tasks that complete asynchronously (e.g., a long build finishing, a scheduled check, a monitoring alert).

The helper function is available inside every agent's Claude Code environment:

```javascript
await sendProactiveMessage(roomId, 'Build complete — 0 errors, 3 warnings.');
```

- `roomId` is automatically injected into the agent's prompt on every trigger (see [Architecture Overview](#architecture-overview)), so the agent always knows which room to post to
- The message is authenticated with the agent's secret — only registered agents can call this endpoint
- The message appears in the room chat just like a normal agent response

**API endpoint** (for external scripts or custom integrations):

```
POST /api/rooms/:roomId/message
Headers:
  X-Agent-Id: <agent numeric ID>
  X-Agent-Secret: <agent secret>
Body: { "content": "your message here" }
```

### Agent Skills

Skills are slash commands available in an agent's Claude Code environment (e.g., `/stoa-audit`, `/deploy`). They're auto-detected from the agent's workdir and displayed in the settings panel.

Skills are **scoped by working directory** — when you create a room with a specific workdir, only skills from that workdir (project/local scope) plus global skills are available. This prevents skill collisions across different projects.

You can invoke a skill in chat by typing the slash command directly:
```
/skill-name
```

---

## Invite Suggestions

AI agents can **suggest inviting** other agents into a room. When an agent thinks another agent's expertise would be helpful, it sends an invite suggestion that appears as a notification in the chat. You can **approve** or **reject** the suggestion.

---

## Push Notifications

Stoa supports browser **push notifications** so you get alerted when agents respond, even when the tab is in the background.

- Toggle notifications on/off in **Settings > General > Notifications**

---

## Sidebar Collapse

Click the **double-chevron button** (‹‹) next to the Stoa logo to hide the room list sidebar, giving more space for the chat and workspace panel. To restore the sidebar, click the **panel icon** that appears in the chat header (or in the empty state).

---

## Workspace Panel

The workspace panel is a code viewer and file browser that appears to the right of the chat. It lets you browse, read, and preview files on the AI agent's machine — including remote servers.

### Opening the Panel

Click the **panel toggle button** (split-pane icon) in the chat header. The panel opens to the right with a resizable drag handle.

### File Tree (Files Tab)

The **Files** tab shows the project directory tree for the room's working directory. Click any file to open it. Folders expand/collapse on click.

### Code Viewer

Text files open with **syntax highlighting** (powered by highlight.js), **line numbers**, and a dark code background. The breadcrumb at the top shows the file path.

### File Editing

Click the **Edit** button on any text file to enter edit mode. The editor uses **CodeMirror 6** with syntax highlighting for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

- **Save**: Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S`) or click the Save button
- **Expand**: Click the expand button to use the editor full-width (hides the chat panel)
- **Conflict detection**: If the file changes on disk while you're editing, a dialog lets you choose to reload or overwrite
- **Auto-save drafts**: Unsaved edits are saved to browser storage. If you close and re-open the file, a recovery prompt appears
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+/` (toggle comment), `Ctrl+Shift+D` (duplicate line), `Alt+Shift+Up/Down` (copy line), `Tab` (indent)

If CodeMirror fails to load (e.g., no internet for CDN), the editor falls back to a plain textarea.

### File Operations (Context Menu)

Right-click any file or folder in the Files tab to open the context menu:

- **New File** — create a new file in the selected folder
- **New Folder** — create a new directory
- **Rename** — rename the file or folder
- **Delete** — remove the file (with confirmation dialog)

On tablets, long-press to open the context menu.

### Markdown Preview

`.md` files render as formatted markdown with headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and links.

### Image Preview

Image files (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, SVG) display as a centered preview. For remote agents, images are fetched via the agent's WebSocket connection.

### Git Diff (Git Tab)

The **Git** tab shows uncommitted changes (`git diff`) with green/red line highlighting, file headers, and change statistics.

### Clickable File Paths

When an AI agent mentions a file path in a message (e.g., `/home/user/project/file.py`), the path becomes **clickable** — click it to open the file in the workspace panel. This works for paths inside backtick code blocks and code fences.

### Download Files

Hover over any file in the file tree to reveal a **download button** (arrow icon). Click it to download the file to your local device. This works for both local and remote agent files — remote files are fetched via WebSocket and delivered as a browser download.

### Remote File Browsing

The workspace works with both local and remote agents. For remote agents, file operations are proxied through the agent's WebSocket connection — you can browse files on any machine the agent runs on, from any device (including tablets and phones).

---

## Export Conversation

You can export a room's full conversation history as **JSON** or **CSV**. Click the **export button** in the chat header and select the format. The download includes all messages, timestamps, and participant names.

---

## Automation

Stoa supports **Slack-triggered automations** — rules that fire when a Slack event matches your conditions and automatically send a prompt to a target room.

### Managing Connections

Go to **Settings > Automation > Connections** to manage your Slack connections. Each connection is a separate Slack Socket Mode session with its own credentials.

Click **+ add connection** to add a new connection:

- **Name** — a label to identify this connection (e.g., "Qiscus Workspace", "Support Bot")
- **Token Type** — `bot` (uses a Bot Token `xoxb-...`) or `user` (uses a User Token `xoxp-...`)
- **App Token** (`xapp-1-...`) — for the Socket Mode WebSocket connection
- **Bot / User Token** — the token that receives events and makes API calls

Each connection card shows its current status: **connecting**, **connected**, **disconnected**, or **error**. Use the **reconnect** button to retry a failed connection, or the **edit** and **delete** buttons to manage it.

See the [Slack setup guide](doc-slack-setup) for step-by-step instructions on creating Slack app tokens.

### Creating an Automation Rule

Once at least one connection is active, click **+ new rule** to create a rule:

- **Name** — a descriptive label for the rule
- **Connection** — which connection triggers this rule, or **Any connection** to match events from all connections
- **Trigger event** — which Slack event fires the rule: `message` (public channels), `message.groups` (private channels), `mention`, or `reaction_added`
- **Conditions** — optional filters: `message_text contains`, `message_text not_contains`, `message_text starts_with`, or `matches_regex`. Multiple conditions are AND-ed together
- **Target room** — which Stoa room receives the triggered message
- **Prompt template** — the message sent to the room. Use variables:
  - `{{slack_message_text}}` — the full message text
  - `{{slack_message_link}}` — permalink to the Slack message
  - `{{slack_user}}` — display name of the sender
  - `{{slack_channel}}` — channel name
  - `{{extracted_url}}` — first URL found in the message
  - `{{slack_thread_ts}}` — thread timestamp

### Enable / Disable

Each rule has an enable/disable toggle. Disabled rules never fire, even if the Slack event matches.

---

## Settings

## Architecture Overview

```
Browser  <-->  WebSocket  <-->  server.js  <-->  Agent (stoa.js)
                                    |                   |
                                 SQLite DB      Claude Code CLI
                                                  or Gemini CLI
                                                  or Ollama
```

- **server.js** — HTTP + WebSocket server, manages rooms, messages, and agent orchestration
- **public/** — frontend (no build step needed)
- **stoa.js** — agent client that runs on each agent machine
- **claude-session.js** — manages the persistent Claude Code CLI subprocess
- **gemini-session.js** — manages the persistent Gemini CLI subprocess
- **gemini-adapter.js** — adapter for Gemini CLI output parsing
- **ollama-session.js** — manages Ollama API calls (no CLI required)
- **SQLite** — all data stored locally in `stoa.db` (WAL mode for performance)

Stoa supports multiple AI backends. Each agent can be configured to use **Claude Code CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, or **Ollama**, chosen when the agent is added. All backends are managed through the same agent client and orchestration layer. Ollama agents connect to a local Ollama server and do not require a separate CLI install.

**Room context in prompt**: Every time an agent is triggered, the server injects `Room ID: <id>` into the agent's system prompt. This means the agent always knows which room it is operating in — enabling it to call `sendProactiveMessage(roomId, ...)` or perform other room-aware operations without needing the ID passed explicitly.

---

## Tips

- **Multiple agents, one room**: Put complementary agents in the same room — e.g., a coder and a reviewer — and let them collaborate via @mentions
- **Dedicated rooms**: Create separate rooms for different topics or projects. Each room maintains its own conversation history
- **Working directories**: Assign different workdirs to different rooms so the same agent can work on multiple projects
- **File sharing**: Drag and drop files directly into the chat — agents can read them immediately
- **Search first**: Before asking an agent a question, use search to check if it was already discussed in another room
